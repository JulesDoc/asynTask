# Asynchronous task library

This program allows the user to manage a number of asynchronous task. It allows start, pause, resume and stop a task and it offers status of one or all tasks created by the user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

The CMake configuration will do most of the job for you, including googletest framework set up, however you should have:

```
CMake 3.1 (or above)
```
```
gcc compiler 5.4.0 (or above)
```

## Installing and running

```
git clone https://github.com/JulesDoc/asynTask.git
```
```
cd asynTask; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make
```
```
Find executable in pix4d/build/main (to run the example program ./myTaskApp)
```
```
Find executable in pix4d/build/unit_tests/testtask (to run the tests ./testtask)
```

## Running the tests

Test are meant to check unit test of the library, namely methods and behavior.
